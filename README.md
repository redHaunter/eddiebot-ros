# Eddiebot ROS

> ROS2 packages for Parallax Eddie robot along with simulations using Gazebo (formerly ignition gazebo)

We have modified some packages config and launch files to improve Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) for our robot Eddie.

This was done for our [University project](https://github.com/arashsm79/robotics-lab/tree/main/Project/Project_Phase_2.md) and steps of implementing can be found in [this link](https://github.com/redHaunter/eddiebot-documents/tree/main)
